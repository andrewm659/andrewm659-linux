How to Install Motion on RaspberryPi

1)  Make sure you system is up to date

sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade

2) Install Motion 

Install the webcam server software using the following command:
# sudo apt-get install motion vim postfix lsof 

3)  Next we need to edit some of the config files so that the motion service will start on run up and be available on local network.

First we will edit the motion.conf file by typing:
# sudo vim /etc/motion/motion.conf

start_motion_daemon=yes

daemon: set to ON to start motion as a daemon service when pi boots,
webcam_localhost: set to OFF so that you can access motion from other computers,
stream_port: the port for the video stream (default 8081),
control_localhost: set to OFF to be able to update parameters remotely via the web config interface,
control_port: the port that you will access the web config interface (default 8080),
framerate: number of frames per second to be captured by the webcam. Warning: setting above 5 fps will hammer your piâ€™s performance!
post_capture: specify the number of frames to be captured after motion has been detected.
