CAUTION PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU GO THROUGH STEP BY STEP OR IT WILL RESULT IN NOT COMPILING


Server list: 
« LIST OF SERVERS TO BE UPDATED »
Console ports:
« LIST OF CONSOLE PORTS »
« If these are Virtual Machines, include the path to the virtual console in vSphere. »
Connect to the console and verify that the root password in https://password.savvis.net/ valid.
*** Test these ahead of time. Replace this line with a note indicating password validity. ***

A. Set Activity Status to "Maintenance Begin."
B. Notify Hosting Edge Management that maintenance is beginning.
C. Contact the customer.
# replace this step with information about contacting the customer prior to
# update. This may also include conference bridge info.
#--- UNIX MOP ---#
« For each server in the list perform the following. »
« sshadmin to server, become root, and run the following: »

1.   Collect pre VMAC information (this only works for bash)
# export VMAC=XXXXXX
# mkdir /var/tmp/PRE-$VMAC
# cp /etc/grub.conf /var/tmp/PRE-$VMAC/grub.conf-$(date +%Y%m%d)
# /sbin/ifconfig -a | tee /var/tmp/PRE-$VMAC/ifconfig-$(date +%Y%m%d)
# mount | tee /var/tmp/PRE-$VMAC/mount-$(date +%Y%m%d)
# cat /etc/fstab | tee /var/tmp/PRE-$VMAC/fstab-$(date +%Y%m%d)
# route -n | tee /var/tmp/PRE-$VMAC/route-$(date +%Y%m%d)
# cat /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/route-eth0 | tee /var/tmp/PRE-$VMAC/route-eth0-$(date +%Y%m%d)
# ps auxwf | tee /var/tmp/PRE-$VMAC/ps-$(date +%Y%m%d)
# /etc/init.d/monitor status | tee /var/tmp/PRE-$VMAC/monitor-$(date +%Y%m%d)
# cat /etc/redhat-release | tee /var/tmp/PRE-$VMAC/redhat-release-$(date +%Y%m%d)
# uname -a | tee /var/tmp/PRE-$VMAC/uname-$(date +%Y%m%d)
# df -h | tee /var/tmp/PRE-$VMAC/df-$(date +%Y%m%d)
# netstat -an | tee /var/tmp/PRE-$VMAC/netstat-$(date +%Y%m%d)
# chkconfig --list | tee /var/tmp/PRE-$VMAC/chkconfig-$(date +%Y%m%d)

2.  As ROOT Install the following packages prior to doing anything
pkg install sudo bash dash zsh vim pdksh mksh ksh93 postfix

3.  Add the users to wheel group
pw usermod username -G wheel

4.  Edit the sudoers file and uncomment the wheel group with no passwd
visudo

## Same thing without a password
# %wheel ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL

5.  Reboot

6.  Edit the /etc/aliases file and add the following
vim /etc/aliases

Shift+G to go to the bottom

i to insert

rancid-NetworkDevices: rancid@tsg2.com
rancid-admin-NetworkDevices: rancid@tsg2.com

Esc
:wq

7.  Make sure the system knows about the new email aliases.  Run this as root
newaliases

8. Configure postfix and Test sending an email and make sure it arrived at its destination
postconf -e 'relayhost = mta.borg.local'
echo 'postfix_enable="YES"' >> /etc/rc.conf
echo 'sendmail_enable="NO"' >> /etc/rc.conf
service postfix start

uname -a | mail -s "`uname -n`: Test mail config"  user@email.com && tail -f /var/log/maillog

9.  Install Rancid
pkg install rancid3

10.  After installation it should have created all the config files for you, so you will need to edit the main one and create a new group (if its not there you will need to copy it using the following)

sudo cp -p /usr/local/etc/rancid/rancid.conf.sample /usr/local/etc/rancid/rancid.conf

sudo vim /usr/local/etc/rancid/rancid.conf

Find the line that says #LIST_OF_GROUPS= and uncomment it.  Inside the quotes erase what is there and give it a group name called NetworkDevices - NO SPACES

a.  Change the directory structure on the CVSROOT line from CVS to SVN:
# Location of the CVS/SVN repository. Be careful changing this.

CVSROOT=$BASEDIR/SVN; export CVSROOT


b.  Change the RCS (Revision Control System) repo from using CVS to Subversion (SVN)
this after CVSROOT has been created with rancid-cvs.  Changing between these
# requires manual conversions.
RCSSYS=svn; export RCSSYS

11.  Next you will need to switch to the rancid user and create a .cloginrc file inside the home directory for rancid.  This will store the username and password to log in to all network devices
su - rancid
touch /usr/local/var/rancid/.cloginrc
chmod 600 .cloginrc

12.  Edit the file you just created AS the USER RANCID
vim .cloginrc

Hit i to insert
add the following lines

add sshcmd 97.91.159.108 {ssh\ -1}
add user 97.91.159.108 ppmrtr
add password 97.91.159.108 F3rengi F3rengi
add password 97.91.191.97 Ranc1d Ranc1d
add password 10.20.30.1 Ranc1d Ranc1d
add sshcmd 10.20.30.1 {ssh\ -1}
add sshcmd 97.91.191.97 {ssh\ -1}
add autoenable 192.168.220.8
add method 192.168.220.9 telnet
add sshcmd 192.168.220.254 {ssh\ -1}
add user * rancid
add password * rancid
add method * ssh
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To connect to devices that only use ssh version use the following command
add sshcmd 1.2.3.4 {ssh\ -1}
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Write and save
Esc
:x!
or
:wq!

13.  Next we are going to populate the folders

/usr/local/bin/rancid-cvs

14.  Next change directories to the new group new name.  In this case NetworkDevices AS the user rancid

cd NetworkDevices

15. After running rancid-cvs there should be a router.db file in there.  Edit this file and add the following information.  If you have other devices such as juniper, the device type would change based on brand.

vim /usr/local/var/rancid/NetworkDevices/router.db

i for insert

192.168.220.1;cisco;up
10.150.1.1;cisco;up

Esc
:wq

17.  Next we are going to check to make sure we can login to the devices.

clogin -s -c"show run;show ver" 10.150.1.1

/usr/local/libexec/rancid/clogin -t 120 -c "show run" 10.150.1.1

18.  Next we are going to add crontab entries so that it constantly checks for updates.
su - rancid
crontab -e

*/10 * * * * /usr/local/bin/rancid-run #hourly router dump
50 23 * * * /usr/local/var/rancid/logs/ -type f –mtime +2 -exec rm -rf {} \;
OR
#/usr/local/var/rancid/logs/NetworkDevices/

19.  To test rancid outside of cron

/usr/local/bin/rancid-run

20.  Install WebSVN

pkg install php56 websvn apache24 mod_dav_svn mod_php56 enscript-letter-1.6.6_1 nenscript-1.13.3 subversion

21.  Edit /usr/local/etc/apache24/modules.d/220_subversion.conf

sudo vim /usr/local/etc/apache24/modules.d/220_subversion.conf
Uncomment the following lines:

echo 'LoadModule dav_svn_module     libexec/apache24/mod_dav_svn.so' >> /usr/local/etc/apache24/modules.d/220_subversion.conf
echo 'LoadModule authz_svn_module   libexec/apache24/mod_authz_svn.so' >> /usr/local/etc/apache24/modules.d/220_subversion.conf

22.  Edit /usr/local/etc/apache24/httpd.conf
vim /usr/local/etc/apache24/httpd.conf

Uncomment the following lines:
LoadModule dav_module libexec/apache24/mod_dav.so
  
23.  Refer to:
